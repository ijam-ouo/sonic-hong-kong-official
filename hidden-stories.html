                  <h2>3 Hours per Work Day</h2>
                  <p>3 Hours per Work Day is a soundwalk inspired from daily life transportation, where time seems to be used on nothing meaningful and all the time is wasted during the ride. The work is adapted from personal daily experiences and reflections, which takes place on a real train ride to imitate Giann’s routine for travelling between school and home. It also uses a second-person perspective storytelling to allow the audience to experience the “wasted time” spent on long-distance traffic, feel the existence of time, and think about the use of time. It really is just a part of life that people don’t like that much, yet also is a place where she hides when she wants to “log out” of reality briefly.</p>
